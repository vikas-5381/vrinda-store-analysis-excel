<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

This  dashboard  analyzes Vrinda Store’s annual sales data to track performance, customer trends, top states, sales channels, and order status and helping the business make better data-driven decisions.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>

Here is the business problem explained in clear points:
- The company has large sales data, but it is difficult to understand performance from raw numbers.
- It is unclear which months generate the highest and lowest sales.
- The business does not know which states contribute the most revenue.
- There is limited visibility into which sales channels (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, etc.) perform best.
- The company needs to understand customer behavior based on age and gender.
- High cancellations, returns, and refunds may be affecting profits.
- Without proper analysis, making data-driven decisions for growth becomes challenging.
